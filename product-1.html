            <b><p>Items in stocks : 32 </p></b>
            <p>The Dell XPS 15 is our new pick for the best laptop of 2020. Dell's 2020 update to its 15-inch flagship ticks pretty much every box when it comes to what<br/> we want from a laptop. The end result is that the Dell XPS 15 (2020) is about as close to perfect as a laptop can get and one of the best Dell laptops to date;<br/> there's really not a lot we can fault it for. It's got some of the latest, and best, mobile tech from Intel, and can even be configured with a discrete GPU, making<br> it adept at image and video editing, and even a spot of light gaming.</p>

<p>It also features one of the finest designs we've seen in a laptop, and is arguably the most stylish Windows 10 laptop on the market right now. Battery life is also<br/> phenomenal, and the price, while high, isn't that bad considering what you get. We're used to seeing Dell's smaller XPS 13 (featured below) at the top of this list,<br/> so we're glad to see its bigger 15-inch sibling bask in the limelight.</p> 
            
    <p>Here is the Dell XPS 15 (2020) configuration sent to TechRadar for review:</p>

                <li><b>CPU:</b> 1.3GHz Intel Core i7-10875H (8-core, 16MB Intel Smart Cache, up to 5.1GHz with Turbo Boost)</li><br/>

          <h3>Performance</h3>
       
          <p>Packed with an Intel Core i7-10875H and an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti, the Dell XPS 15 definitely falls into what we would call the "prosumer" market. It's<br/> not so powerful that professional video editors or 3D artists are going to jump for it, but it's definitely powerful for anyone that does that stuff for a hobby, or just<br/> doesn't want to get slowed down by any computing task that they may run into. </p>
          
    <p>Here’s how the Dell XPS 15 (2020) performed in our suite of benchmark tests:</p>

                <li><b>Cinebench R20 CPU:</b>  3,557 points</li><br/>
                <li><b>Cinebench R15 CPU:</b>  1,519 points</li><br/>

          <h3>Buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You want a powerful laptop</h4>
<p>Packed with Intel's latest Comet Lake-H processors, the XPS 15 will absolutely chew through pretty much any workload you throw at it.</p> 

<h4>You want a stylish piece of kit</h4>
The Dell XPS 15 is probably the most profound year-over-year glow-up we've ever seen in a laptop. At this point, it is probably the most<br/> stylish Windows laptop on the market, and definitely even gives the MacBook Pro a run for its money.

<h4>You want an affordable flagship</h4>
Unfortunately "Flagship" is typically synonymous with "expensive", but starting at just $1,299 (about ₤1,030, AU$1,890) in the US, the<br/> Dell XPS 15 is probably the most affordable device in its class.  
          <hr/>
<h3>Don't buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You want a gaming laptop</h4>
Because the laptop is packed with just an Nvidia GeForce GTX 1050 Ti at its highest configuration, we wouldn't recommend this device<br/> if gaming is one of your top priorities.

<h4>You want something smaller</h4>
While the Dell XPS 15 is definitely portable for a 15-inch laptop, it's still a 15-inch laptop. If you want something ultra-portable, we'd<br/> recommend checking out the best Ultrabooks and 13-inch laptops.
