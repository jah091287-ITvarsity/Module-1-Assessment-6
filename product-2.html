          <h3>Buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You want lightweight performance</h4>
<p>The HP Spectre x360 delivers the best in convertible laptop performance without compromising its ultralight and sleek design. This is a laptop that can handle<br/> the sort of tasks that you’d need a desktop PC for five years ago, and it’s awesome.</p> 

<h4>You need flexibility</h4>
Swapping between laptop and tablet modes on the HP Spectre x360 feels like a dream, thanks to the gorgeous 4K touchscreen and robust two-point hinge. With<br/> good battery life and the help of Windows 10’s Tablet Mode, this device is as flexible as they come.

<h4>You want security</h4>
Simply put, the physical security features offered by the HP Spectre x360 put it ahead of most other 2-in-1s. Add in some antivirus software and regular malware<br/> scans with Windows Defender, and you’ve got yourself a super-secure system.  
          <hr/>
<h3>Don't buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You need more power</h4>
If you’re working with high-level editing or rendering software, you’re going to need something bigger than the HP Spectre x360 (2020). There isn’t a laptop this<br/> lightweight that can really do it, unfortunately.
          
<h4>You’re on a budget</h4>
The HP Spectre x360 is top-of-the-line, but it has a price tag to match. If you’re trying to keep the bottom line low, it’s better to opt for something less flashy, like<br/> a Chromebook or Lenovo’s new ThinkPads.
