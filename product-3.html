            <b><p>Items in stocks : 4 </p></b>
            <p>The Dell XPS 13 has been a regular of our best laptops list for years, and the 2020 again earns a well-deserved spot. It keeps everything we've come to love from Dell's flagship 13-incher, from the gorgeous and light design, to the powerful modern components that power it. The Dell XPS 13 now rocks 10th-generation Intel Core i5 or i7 processors and a bezel-less ‘Infinity Edge’ display, which means the Dell XPS 13 (2020) is a brilliant performer, while remaining thin and light.</p>

<p>What’s more, there’s a wide range of customization options, so you can really make the Dell XPS 13 the best laptop for your needs. The 2020 model refines the already-brilliant design of the XPS 13, but it does come at a high cost. While this is easily  one of the best laptops in the world right now, it's also one of the most expensive as well</p>
            
    <p>Here is the Dell XPS 13 (2020) configuration sent to TechRadar for review: </p>

          <h3>Buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You're after something fancy</h4>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is without a doubt one of the most premium-feeling laptops we've laid hands on, and it will doubtless get some glances at the local coffee shop. It's a laptop you'll want to show off. </p> 

<h4>You want a beautiful display</h4>
<p>Dell excels with its display yet again, delivering a panel that's bright and color accurate. And, with the tiny bezels, your entire view will be screen.</p> 
          
<h4>You want something lightweight/h4>
<p>This is an incredibly thin and light laptop, making it super easy to carry around wherever you have to go. If you want a competent computing device that feels like a feather, this is it.</p>   
          <hr/>
<h3>Don't buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You're on a budget</h4>
<p>The Dell XPS 13 is a premium device, and with that comes a pretty steep price tag. You can get the same level of hardware elsewhere for less cash.</p>
          
<h4>You want great laptop audio</h4>
<p>Dell chose to put the speakers on the bottom of the laptop again, which means that audio quality isn't great. You can get around this by using some headphones, but when you're paying this much, we'd like to see better built-in speakers.</p>
