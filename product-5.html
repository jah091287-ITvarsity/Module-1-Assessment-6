            <p>While we are sad that the 15-inch MacBook Pro is no more, we’ve welcomed the MacBook Pro (16-inch, 2019) with open arms. As thin, light and sleek<br/> as ever, you wouldn’t think this was a 16-inch behemoth. </p> 

<p>Yet, you’re getting that extra real estate on that stunning display, as well as the latest and greatest components behind it. This is, without a doubt, the best<br/> MacBook for content creators, designers and other creative professionals. With amazing (and loud) speakers and a much, much better keyboard to boot.</p> 
            
    <p>Here is the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019) configuration sent to TechRadar for review:</p>

          <h3>Performance</h3>
       
          <p>The MacBook Pro 16-inch is the most powerful MacBook ever made – especially if you splash out on the fully-loaded option. It’s pricey, but with<br/> an 8-core Intel processor, 64GB RAM and 8TB SSD, you’ll not get another laptop quite like it.</p>
          
    <p>Here’s how the 16-inch MacBook Pro (2019) performed in our suite of benchmark tests:</p>
          
          <ol>
                <li><b>Cinebench CPU:</b> 3,157 points Graphics: 122.31 fps</li><br/>
                <li><b>Geekbench 4 Single-Core:</b> 5,375; Multi-Core: 28,332</li><br/>
                <li><b>Geekbench 5 Single-Core:</b> 974; Multi-Core: 6,035</li><br/>
                <li><b>Battery Life (TechRadar movie test):</b> 11 hours and 41 minutes</li><br/>

<h4>You want the most powerful MacBook ever</h4>
<p>Apple has done an amazing job of improving most aspects of the MacBook Pro with the new 16-inch model, and while it’s not a generational leap in<br/> terms of power compared to the 15-inch model, if you’re after the most powerful MacBook ever made, this is it.</p> 

<h4>You want a workstation laptop that lasts a whole workday</h4>
The battery life on the MacBook Pro 16-inch is very impressive, considering the powerful components and larger screen. Depending on the workload,<br/> this will keep you going throughout the work day on a single charge – though any heavy video rendering and the like will obviously drain the battery faster.
          
<h4>You loved everything about the MacBook Pro – but want more</h4>
Apple set out to give its customers “more of what they love” with the MacBook Pro 16-inch, and it succeeded. You get that classic MacBook Pro form factor,<br/> with not much extra size or weight added, along with a bigger screen, more powerful components, a better keyboard, better speakers and much more.
          <hr/>
<h3>Don't buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You’re on a tight budget</h4>
The MacBook Pro 16-inch costs the same for the base model as the previous 15-inch model. That’s to be commended, but make no mistake – this is still a very<br/> expensive laptop. If you’re on a budget, there are more affordable options out there.
          
<h4>You don’t need the power</h4>
Part of the reason that the MacBook Pro 16-inch is so expensive is because of the powerful cutting edge components included. That means if you don’t need that<br/> amount of raw power (and unless you’re using it for professional video editing, music producing, 3D modelling and the like, then you won’t), you’re better off<br/> buying the cheaper MacBook Pro 13-inch, or the MacBook Air.

<h4>You prefer Windows</h4>
If you’re a Windows die-hard and hate all things Apple, then this is not the laptop for you. However, you may want to reconsider – macOS Catalina is not that<br/> difficult to get the hang of, after all. Otherwise, there are some good Windows-based alternatives out there.
