            <b><p>Items in stocks : 11 </p></b>
            <p>Beyond the Acer Swift 3's modest exterior, you'll find an excellent laptop that boasts plenty of power for work and study. The Swift 3 (not to be<br/> confused with the Switch 3 another laptop from Acer) is an inexpensive laptop; however, that plain chassis is all-aluminum and packed with<br/> beefy components.</p> 

<p>In terms of performance, it gets surprisingly close to the far more expensive Microsoft Surface Laptop. Its display is a little lower-res, but the<br/> two are otherwise strikingly similar - other than the price.</p> 

<p>This laptop is incredible to use as well, with its roomy trackpad as well as its backlit keyboard that offers a comfortable typing experience<br/>  with decent travel. If you're going to be writing a lot – whether you’re traveling or at the office, this is one of the best budget laptops 2020<br/> has on offer.</p>
            
    <p>Here is the Acer Swift 3 (2020) configuration sent to TechRadar for review:</p>

          <h3>Buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You don't want to take out a loan for an Ultrabook</h4>
<p>Ultrabooks have always been a bit more of a premium laptop, but the Acer Swift 3 aims at bringing a quality Ultrabook to the wider, more budget-conscious consumer. It's definitely succeeded in this respect.</p> 

<h4>You are looking for a highly-portable laptop</h4>
The compact dimensions and light weight of the Acer Swift 3 make it one of the most portable laptops out there right now, making it perfect for students running back and forth around campus or for freelance professionals on the go.

<h4>You're looking for a minimalist design in your laptop</h4>
While not quite as refined as the MacBook Air, its not out of the question that the Acer Swift 3 could be mistaken for one if you don't look too closely.
          <hr/>
<h3>Don't buy it if...</h3>
          <hr/>
<h4>You want something that will game as hard as it works</h4>
We always want it all when it comes to our tech, but its important to know what the Acer Swift 3 isn't. If you're looking for a laptop for e-sports – this ain't it, chief.
          
<h4>You're an audiophile</h4>
There's just no getting around the serviceable speakers. You will hear what you need to hear while actively working on the Swift 3, but if you're going to spend the day cleaning around the house, this should be your last choice for a stereo unless the alternative is an alarm clock-radio.
